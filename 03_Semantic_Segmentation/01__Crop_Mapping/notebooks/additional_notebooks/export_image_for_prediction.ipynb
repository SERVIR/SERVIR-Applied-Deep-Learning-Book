You can use `GCS_IMAGE_DIR` to specify where inside the `GCS_BUCKET` you want to keep your prediction image. Similarly, you can use `GCS_IMAGE_PREFIX` to specify the file name prefix for the export image. In general, you can use them to construct the `file_name_prefix` (equivalent to fileNamePrefix in the `Export.image.toCloudStorage` function). Let's say I have a bucket with the name `dl-book`, and I want to store the exported image inside the sub-directory `chapter-1/images` with `image_2021` as my file name prefix, equivalent to `gs://dl-book/chapter-1/images/image_2021*.TFRecord`, then the config settings looks as below.\n",
